Weekend Challenge 5 - OMDB Search and Store Favorite Movies
===========================================================

This application is a full stack web application to find movies from the OMDB (Open Movie Database) and save them to your favorites list.  **Note:** This application was made when OMDB API was free to use and is no longer functional.  Because of the changes at OMDB, the application no longer searches.  The application still displays favorite movies and those movies can be deleted.  Prior to changes at OMDB, a user could search for a movie using a word or words and would be returned movies to choose from.  User could select a movie as a favorite and it would be saved on the favorites page.

This project was built over a weekend.
